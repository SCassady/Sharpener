# Sharpener
Style linter for C-Sharp. At present, it checks if opening parentheses for statement blocks are given their own line. If not,
they are moved. More functionality will be added later.

## Installation
Simply clone the repository to your local machine.

## Instructions
Place the .cs files you wish to be styled in the Test folder (name will be changed later). Then, simply
run Replacer.py at the command line (ie. python replacer.py).

All .cs files in the Test folder will be copied and styled, with the output
being copied to the Results folder.

## Future changes
I'm planning on using this script for a simple styling SPA. Also, I may add more styling or linting functionality.
